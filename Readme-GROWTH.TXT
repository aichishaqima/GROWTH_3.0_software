GROWTH is a software for determination of subsurface anomalous density structures from discrete gravity anomaly values. It works in a context of free 3D geometry of the causative bodies. From only very general assumptions, the code determines, in a nearly automatic approach, general anomalous structures described as aggregation of thousands of small rectangular prisms.


This package includes:


    (a) Fortran source codes:   GROWTH.for and VIEW.for
        
         and the User Manual:   UserManual-GROWTH.txt


    (b) Two executable files (if files can appear as  *-exe, please rename as *.exe to execute): 

                  GROWTH.exe
 
                  VIEW.exe 


    (c) Files for an application example, corresponding to a gravity survey in the volcanic Island of El Hierro (Canary Islands).


                  Data files:   GRA.DAT , and MAP.BLN  (the second one,only for pictures)
 
                  Output files:    MOD.DAT, FIL.DAT


   (d) Additional files (*.vfproj, *.h, *.rc, *.ico, etc) for compilation.
